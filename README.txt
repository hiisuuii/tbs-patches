A set of miscellaneous patches for The Broken Script for 1.20.1.
The patches are as follows:
- Disabling banning by default
- Disabling crashing by default
- Disabling the VHS filter by default
- Disabling the "base exploding event" by default
- Re-enabling the "Quit Game" button on the main menu
- Re-enabling the use of in-game commands when cheats are enabled
- Making the checked-ness of the checkboxes in TBS's config menu match their actual value (without this patch, the config screen defaults everything to "false", regardless of its value when the screen was opened)

Config options for each of these patches exist at `config/tbspatch-common.toml`.
These config patches do NOT affect The Broken Script's in-game config menu. After entering a world, you can still use the original mod's config menu as normal. This mod only serves to change the default value of certain configs to make the mod less destructive, and to provide the ability to disable some features of the original mod which could be described as "somewhat annoying" for youtubers and streamers.
